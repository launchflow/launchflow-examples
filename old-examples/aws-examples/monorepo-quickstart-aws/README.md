This example shows you how to setup a monorepo with launchflow. Here we have two services:

- `service1`
- `service2`

each with their own directory and Dockerfile. To setup a monorepo we simple reference both of them in our `launchflow.yaml`, and launchflow will automatically build and deploy both services.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install LaunchFlow

This application is automated with [LaunchFlow](https://docs.launchflow.com/). <br/> Make sure you have it installed before running the commands below.


```bash
# Install LaunchFlow with pip
pip install launchflow[aws]

# NOTE: If you are using zsh, you may need to escape the square brackets
pip install launchflow\[aws\]
```

If this is your first time using LaunchFlow, you will need to connect your cloud provider account.

```bash
# This will open a browser window to authenticate with AWS
launchflow connect --provider AWS
```

## ‚öíÔ∏è Create your Infrastructure

Automatically <strong>find</strong> and <strong>create</strong> all infrastructure used by your application.

```bash
launchflow create
```

Learn how this command works in the [LaunchFlow Docs](https://docs.launchflow.com/reference/cli#launchflow-create).

## üèÉ Run your Application (local)

Install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the FastAPI application locally using [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/).

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Learn how this command works in the [FastAPI Docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/manually/#run-a-server-manually-uvicorn).

## üöÄ Deploy your Application (remote)

Automatically <strong>build</strong> and <strong>deploy</strong> the FastAPI application to your cloud.

```bash
launchflow deploy
```

Learn how this command works in the [LaunchFlow Docs](https://docs.launchflow.com/reference/cli#launchflow-deploy).

## üßπ Clean up your infrastructure

Automatically <strong>delete</strong> all infrastructure <strong>NOT</strong> currently used in your application code.

This is useful for finding and removing old resources that are no longer needed.

```bash
launchflow clean
```

Learn how this command works in the [LaunchFlow Docs](https://docs.launchflow.com/reference/cli#launchflow-clean).

## üí• Destroy your infrastructure

Automatically <strong>delete</strong> all infrastructure associated with your application.

```bash
launchflow destroy
```

Learn how this command works in the [LaunchFlow Docs](https://docs.launchflow.com/reference/cli#launchflow-destroy).
